## Customer Propensity to Purchase Model 
#### By Kevin Eddy

### Introduction
Propensity modeling encompasses various techniques for constructing predictive models that anticipate the actions of a target audience based on their historical behaviors. Basically, these models assist in gauging the probability of an individual undertaking a specific action. We can then use this likelihood or probability score to create personalized targeting campaigns for the users, thus reducing a businessâ€™ total cost (targeting only a small set of users) and increasing the ROI.

### Business Objective
The client, an early-stage e-commerce company, seeks to improve its low conversion rate by implementing a targeted discount campaign. Due to limited funds, they are exploring predictive analytics models, particularly propensity modeling and RFM modeling. Propensity modeling will predict user purchase probabilities, and RFM modeling will enhance segmentation for personalized marketing. By combining these approaches, the company aims to efficiently allocate resources, targeting users who genuinely require incentives for purchases and optimizing user engagement and retention.

### Data Description
The dataset contains the purchase history of various users over a period of time for an e-commerce company. It includes the following information about the users: demographics, customer acquisition, User Acvitity, and Category/Sub-Category features. It also contains a target variable that indicates whether the user made a purchase or not.
